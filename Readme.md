# Generator Class

The class generator aims to help the programmer when creating their classes, saving time in their project

## Getting Started

To start using the generator, it is very easy, just follow the tips below

### Prerequisites

To test some program from this repository, you need to have Java installed on your machine, if you do not have it, Java has a documentation explaining [how to install the Java virtual machine](https://www.java.com/pt_BR/download/help/windows_manual_download.xml)

## Running the tests


```
C:\Users\Joao Victor>cd C:\Users\Joao Victor\Documents\Repositorios\uri-exercises\beginners\1012 - Área
```

Then compile the program:
```
C:\Users\Joao Victor\Documents\Repositorios\uri-exercises\beginners\1012 - Área>javac Main.java
```

And now just run:
```
C:\Users\Joao Victor\Documents\Repositorios\uri-exercises\beginners\1012 - Área>java Main
3
5
9.8
```

In this case, program 1012 will return you:
```
TRIANGULO: 14,700
CIRCULO: 301,718
TRAPEZIO: 39,200
QUADRADO: 25,000
RETANGULO: 15,000
